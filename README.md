Game description with basic game rules:
A fishing game, the things you can catch are random. Fishing requires the use of baits and fishing rods. Bait is a consumable item that needs to be purchased. Fishing rods can be upgraded as players upgrade, the better it is, the higher the probability of catching expensive fish. Fishing can gain money(for purchasing baits) and experience(for the player upgrade his level). Player level increases with experience, and fishing rods can also be upgraded.
Players have a certain amount of initial money at the beginning and earn more money by selling fish.
Sometimes itâ€™s not the fish but junk or jewels that are caught, there is a certain chance that fishing times will trigger a random event, we will try to bring surprises to this game.
